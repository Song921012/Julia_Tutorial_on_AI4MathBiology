abstract="Human behaviours are key determinants of the course, duration and outcomes of disease outbreaks, and behavioural change transmission dynamics have proved to be power tool in guiding public health measures in epidemic control. Nonetheless, how to develop computationally tractable first principle of behavioural change in epidemic models with good generalization and predictability remains a challenge. Neural networks, despite the perception of being a black-box uniform approximator and difficult to interpret, have an incredible effectiveness in learning unknown mechanisms in differential equations with bless of dimensionality. In this study, we propose an epidemiology-informed two-step recovering-explaining method which balances the learning ability and interprecity, to learn the behavioural change mechanisms in transmission dynamics and represent the mechanisms in closed form by formulas as simple as possible. The proposed method can also give new insights to patterns of disease outbreaks in modern era.",

  abstract  = {Deep Neural Network training spends most of the computation on
               examples that are properly handled, and could be ignored. We
               propose to mitigate this phenomenon with a principled
               importance sampling scheme that focuses computation on
               "informative" examples, and reduces the variance of the
               stochastic gradients during training. Our contribution is
               twofold: first, we derive a tractable upper bound to the
               per-sample gradient norm, and second we derive an estimator of
               the variance reduction achieved with importance sampling,
               which enables us to switch it on when it will result in an
               actual speedup. The resulting scheme can be used by changing a
               few lines of code in a standard SGD procedure, and we
               demonstrate experimentally on image classification, CNN
               fine-tuning, and RNN training, that for a fixed wall-clock
               time budget, it provides a reduction of the train losses of up
               to an order of magnitude and a relative improvement of test
               errors between 5\% and 17\%.},
